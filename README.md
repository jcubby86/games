## Games
1. The Name Game: Everyone secretly enters the name of a person (real or fictional) that others would know. Players then take turns guessing each other's names until only one remains!
2. He Said She Said: Each player answers the same six prompts. Stories are then built randomly using different players' answers for each prompt.
